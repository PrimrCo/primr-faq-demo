# Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance Framework

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (for integration tests)
- OpenAI API key (for AI quality tests)
- **🔴 CRITICAL: Playwright browsers installed (for E2E tests)**

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# 🚨 REQUIRED: Install Playwright browsers for E2E tests
npx playwright install

# Alternative: Install only Chromium to save space
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Running Tests

**🚨 IMPORTANT: E2E tests require both Playwright browsers AND the development server**

```bash
# Method 1: Automatic (Playwright starts server)
npm run test:e2e

# Method 2: Manual (2 terminals)
# Terminal 1: Start the development server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run E2E tests
npx playwright test
```

Other test types:
```bash
# Run all tests except E2E (no external dependencies)
npm test

# Individual test categories
npm run test:unit          # No external dependencies
npm run test:integration   # Requires MongoDB
npm run test:ai-quality    # Requires OpenAI API key
npm run test:performance   # No external dependencies

# Development
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
npm run quality:report     # Generate quality report
```

## 🌐 End-to-End Testing (Simplified)

### Current E2E Test Coverage

**Note: This is a simplified test suite for basic smoke testing. The comprehensive 60+ test suite mentioned in comments has been simplified to a single smoke test.**

Current test validates:
- ✅ Homepage loads successfully
- ✅ Page title matches expected pattern (`/Primr Event Manager/`)
- ✅ Basic page structure exists (body element visible)
- ✅ Page content is not empty

### Browser Support

- **Desktop**: Chromium only (simplified from multi-browser)
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Test Type**: Basic smoke test

### Troubleshooting E2E Tests

**Common Issues:**

1. **"browserType.launch: Failed to launch chromium"**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Install Playwright browsers
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **"Connection refused"**
   → Development server not running (`npm run dev`)

3. **"Error: expect(received).toHaveTitle(expected)"**
   → Page title doesn't match `/Primr Event Manager/` pattern

4. **Tests timing out**
   → Server starting slowly, wait longer or check if port 3000 is free

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/user-workflows.spec.ts

# Debug mode (step through)
npx playwright test --debug

# Check installed browsers
npx playwright --version
npx playwright install --dry-run
```

## ✅ Test Status Requirements

**For E2E tests to pass:**
- ✅ **Playwright browsers installed** (`npx playwright install`)
- ✅ Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Page title contains "Primr Event Manager"
- ✅ Basic page structure renders correctly
- ✅ No critical JavaScript errors prevent page load

**Browser Storage Location:**
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/ms-playwright`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: E2E test expects page title `/Primr Event Manager/` - verify your app's title
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB service is running for integration tests
3. **OpenAI API**: Verify API key configuration for AI quality tests
4. **Playwright Setup**: Run `npx playwright install` for E2E tests
5. **Coverage Thresholds**: Increase test coverage to meet 70% requirement

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run specific test files
npm test tests/unit/infrastructure.spec.ts

# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=* npm test
```
