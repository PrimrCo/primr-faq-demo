## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive testing framework with multiple test types and quality assurance tools.

### Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB running locally (for integration tests)
- OpenAI API key (for AI quality tests)

**Installation:**
```sh
# Install test dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers for E2E tests
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests (requires MongoDB)
npm run test:ai-quality     # AI quality validation tests  
npm run test:performance    # Performance and load tests
npm run test:e2e            # End-to-end tests with Playwright

# Development & Debugging
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage reports
npm run test:ci             # CI mode with full reporting

# Quality Assurance
npm run quality:check       # Complete quality validation
npm run quality:report      # Generate comprehensive quality report
```

### Test Environment Setup

For testing, create a `.env.test` file or ensure these variables are set:

```bash
NODE_ENV=test
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/primr-faq-test
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test-secret-key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=test-bucket
```

### Test Types Included

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests** - Test API endpoints and database interactions
3. **AI Quality Tests** - Validate AI response accuracy and quality
4. **Performance Tests** - Load testing and performance validation
5. **E2E Tests** - Full user workflow testing across browsers

### Quality Requirements

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% across lines, functions, branches, and statements
- **Performance**: Response times must meet defined thresholds
- **AI Quality**: Automated evaluation of response accuracy and relevance
- **Cross-Browser**: Testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

For detailed testing documentation, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Example UI Integration

Hereâ€™s how the UI interacts with the API (excerpt from [`app/page.tsx`](app/page.tsx)):

```tsx
const handleUpload = async () => {
  if (!file) return setMessage("Please select a file.");
  setUploading(true);
  setMessage("");
  setParsedText("");
  setAnswer("");
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);

  const res = await fetch("/api/upload", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
  });

  const data = await res.json();
  setUploading(false);
  if (data.success) {
    setMessage("File uploaded and parsed successfully!");
    setParsedText(data.parsedText || "");
  } else {
    setMessage(data.error || "Upload failed.");
  }
};

const handleAsk = async () => {
  if (!question.trim()) return;
  setAsking(true);
  setAnswer("");
  const res = await fetch("/api/faq", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ question }),
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  setAsking(false);
  setAnswer(data.answer || "No answer found.");
};
```

## FAQ

**Q: My OpenAI API key is not working!**
A: Make sure it is set in `.env.local` as `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` and restart your dev server.

**Q: Why do I get "Unauthorized" errors?**
A: You must be signed in with Google to use the upload and FAQ endpoints.

**Q: Where are my files stored?**
A: Files are uploaded to your configured S3 bucket, organized by user email.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Environment variables not loading:**
  - Ensure `.env.local` is in the project root.
  - Restart your dev server after editing `.env.local`.

- **API key errors:**
  - Never use `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` in client-side code.
  - Only use it in API routes.

- **S3 upload errors:**
  - Check your AWS credentials, bucket name, and permissions.

- **MongoDB errors:**
  - Ensure your `MONGODB_URI` is correct and the database is accessible.

---

## Event Grouping

- All uploaded documents and Q&A are grouped by "Event".
- You can create, select, and manage events from the UI.
- Uploaded files, chat history, and answers are always scoped to the currently selected event.
- This allows you to keep documents and conversations organized by project, meeting, or topic.

### How to Use Events

1. **Create or select an event** using the event selector in the UI.
2. **Upload documents** to the selected event.
3. **Ask questions** and view chat history, all scoped to the current event.
4. **Switch events** to see different sets of files and Q&A.

## Commands

### `/ask-primr check-environment`

Use this command to verify your environment configuration.
It checks for required environment variables and prints their status.

**Usage:**
```sh
npx ask-primr check-environment
```

**What it does:**
- Verifies all required environment variables are set.
- Prints a summary of your configuration.
- Helps debug setup issues before running the app.
